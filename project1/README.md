 - Given survey data, predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked
 - Utilized decision trees and feature engineering to determine which features were the most important and trimmed the attributes that were not useful
 - Reached an accuracy for 73% and was able to predict if they were satisfied with the company
 - Algorithms used: SVC, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression
